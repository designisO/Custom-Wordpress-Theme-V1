# Theme Development in WordPress & PHP

In this repo, I am learning more about the awesome world of WordPress and PHP. The goal is to learn how to create custom themes & plugins before the end of September 2022. Let's dive in.

- For PHP install locally go to: PHP.net: PHP is what allows the pulling of data from the database to the site. Server side scripting and programming language.
- MySQL- The database where all the data, passwords and more are stored.
- WP REST API - Uses JS to interact with the PHP code and database.
- WP Coding Standards: Link: https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/
 

#### Installing WP Locally.
For this step I was able to use Local by Flywheel. https://localwp.com/ is where you can download the free software to build WP sites locally.


#### Creating a custom theme
Learned how to upload a custom theme in the WP dashboard. Also was able to add the thumbnail of the theme. The file must be a png file with size of 1200 x 900.

#### Common Files
Common files for the WP theme are the following:
- functions.php
- style.css
- header.php
- footer.php
- index.php
- single.php
- page.php

#### Functions and Arrays in PHP
WP has it's own functions. Functions learned was:
  -bloginfo();
  -have_posts();
  -the_posts();

  -the_permalink();
  -the_title();
