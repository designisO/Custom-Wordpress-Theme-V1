# Theme Development in WordPress & PHP

In this repo, I am learning more about the awesome world of WordPress and PHP. The goal is to learn how to create custom themes & plugins before the end of September 2022. Let's dive in.


#### Installing WP Locally.
For this step I was able to use Local by Flywheel. https://localwp.com/ is where you can download the free software to build WP sites locally.


#### Creating a custom theme
Learned how to upload a custom theme in the WP dashboard. Also was able to add the thumbnail of the theme. The file must be a png file with size of 1200 x 900.

#### Functions and Arrays in PHP
WP has it's own functions. Functions learned was:
  -bloginfo();
  -have_posts();
  -the_posts();
  -the_content();
  -the_permalink();
  -the_title();
  -get_header();
  -get_footer();
  -wp_list_pages();
  -wp_get_post_id();
  -get_the_title();
  -get_permalink();
